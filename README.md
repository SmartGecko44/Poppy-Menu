# Poppy-Menu
Basically a copy of the Poppy Menu from Mac OS. I have only tested it on Kali Linux so open an issue if you encounter any errors.

# Prerequisites
Gnome Extensions (```sudo apt-get install gnome-shell-extensions```)

# Install
To install the extension just extract the zip file into ```~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions```, then press **Alt + F2** and type **r** (Then press enter). Once Gnome has finished reloading search for the program **Extensions** and enable Poppy Menu.

# Known issues
In the Kali version the update button isn't working
